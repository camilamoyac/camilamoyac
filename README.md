# Hello world! I'm Camila 🌿

## 🍃 About me

I'm a **software developer** passionate about creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly digital experiences. Currently studying Software Development at **BYU Idaho**, I’m always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with others.

When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading, baking or singing. I also love spending time with my family, and experimenting with creative projects. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills, both in programming and in life. My goal is to build projects that make a meaningful impact on the world.
